Spaceship is fueled and we are ready to blast off to mars 
We are docked in the Space Station, waiting for slingshot to mars
AN ALIEN INVASION?!?
We have landed successfully on mars, it is amazingly orange
The rover is going crazy on Mars
The rover is scooping soil from the planet
We found more aliens underGROUND!
